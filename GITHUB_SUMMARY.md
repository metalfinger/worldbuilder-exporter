## GitHub Large File Warnings
Some asset files exceed GitHub's recommended file size limits:
- TGA texture files (64MB each)
- GLB model file (82.53MB)
These warnings are expected for 3D asset files and do not affect functionality.

## Next Steps
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/metalfinger/worldbuilder-exporter.git`
2. Install dependencies if needed
3. Run the development server: `node server.js`
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5500`

The project is now fully available on GitHub with all enhancements and fixes implemented.
