# UI Redesign - Photoshop-like Interface Implementation

## Overview
Redesigned the WorldBuilder interface to have a more Photoshop-like layout with:
- Toolbar centered vertically on the left side
- Tool panels (Brush/Sticker) centered vertically on the right side
- Removed unnecessary panels (Layers, Minimap)

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Updates (style.css)

#### Toolbar Positioning
- Changed from top-left positioning to vertically centered on left side
- Added background, border, and shadow for better visual separation
- Maintained glassmorphism effects

#### Tool Panels Positioning
- Changed from bottom-left positioning to vertically centered on right side
- Updated both floating-brush-panel and floating-sticker-panel
- Added consistent styling with toolbar

#### Mobile Responsiveness
- Updated mobile toolbar to maintain vertical centering
- Modified mobile panels to stay on right side rather than slide up from bottom
- Maintained appropriate sizing for mobile devices

#### Layer Panel Removal
- Completely hid floating-layers-panel and all related elements
- Set display: none !important for all layer-related CSS classes
- Ensured no layer elements show on any screen size

### 2. Visual Improvements
- Enhanced toolbar with better visual styling (background, border, shadow)
- Consistent positioning of all panels for predictable UI
- Improved glassmorphism effects across all panels

### 3. User Experience
- More intuitive layout similar to professional design tools
- Easier access to tools with central positioning
- Cleaner interface without clutter from unnecessary panels

## Files Modified
- `style.css` - Updated positioning and styling for all panels

## Testing
- Verified layout on desktop and mobile views
- Confirmed all tools (paint, eraser, sticker, rotate) work correctly
- Checked responsive design on different screen sizes
- Ensured no visual artifacts or layout issues

## Benefits
- More professional, Photoshop-like interface
- Better organization of tools and panels
- Cleaner, less cluttered workspace
- Consistent layout across all device sizes
