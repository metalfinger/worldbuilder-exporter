const clock = new THREE.Clock();

// 1. Scene Setup
const { scene, camera, renderer, controls } = setupScene();

// 2. UI Setup
const { setMode } = setupUI(camera, renderer, controls);

// 3. Model Loading
loadModel(scene, (model) => {
    // 4. Animation Setup
    const mixer = setupAnimation(model);

    // 5. Initialize masks after model and textures are loaded
    initializeMasks();

    // Start the animation loop once the model is loaded
    animate(mixer);
});

// Animation loop
function animate(mixer) {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => animate(mixer));

    const delta = clock.getDelta();

    // Update the main mixer for the model
    if (m mixer) {
        mixer.update(delta);
    }

    controls.update();
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

## Technical Architecture

### Rendering Pipeline
1. Three.js Scene renders 3D model with custom materials
2. Paint Canvas (HTML5 Canvas) stores all painting data
3. Canvas Texture connects paint canvas to 3D material
4. Real-time Updates sync canvas changes to 3D rendering

### Data Flow
```
User Input ‚Üí Event Handler ‚Üí Canvas Modification ‚Üí Texture Update ‚Üí 3D Render
     ‚Üì
UI Updates ‚Üê Performance Optimization ‚Üê Cursor Tracking ‚Üê Mouse/Touch Events
```

### Multi-Screen Workflow
```
Screen 1: Base Color Selection
    ‚Üì
Screen 2: Paint & Style
    ‚Üì
Screen 3: Pose & Finish ‚Üí Export Creation
```

## Asset Management

### 3D Model Assets (`GLBandFBX_010725/`)

### Texture Conversion Script
The project includes a `convert_textures.sh` script that automatically converts TGA texture files to WebP format for better web performance:
- Uses ImageMagick to convert TGA ‚Üí PNG ‚Üí WebP
- Maintains quality at 50% for optimal file size
- Automatically cleans up temporary PNG files after conversion

### Sticker Assets (`stickers/`)
- **9 PNG files** (sticker1.png through sticker9.png)
- **Recommended size**: 256x256 pixels
- **Format**: PNG with transparency

### Animation Assets (`assets/`)
- **Record_Animation1.fbx**: Character animation sequences
- **audio.mp3**: Background audio for recording (if used)

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Hardware Acceleration**: CSS transforms with `translate3d` and `will-change`
2. **Throttled Updates**: Mouse movement throttling with requestAnimationFrame
3. **Efficient Canvas Operations**: Batch canvas operations
4. **Memory Optimization**: Limited undo history and proper texture disposal
5. **Rendering Optimization**: Shadow mapping and tone mapping configurations

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Run `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `node server.js` to start development server
2. **Development**: Make changes to source files and refresh browser
3. **Testing**: Verify all modes work correctly (paint, rotate, sticker)
4. **VS Code Integration**: Project includes VS Code tasks for starting development server
5. **Deployment**: Optimize assets and configure server for production

## Multi-Screen Workflow

The application follows a guided three-screen workflow:

### Screen 1: Base Color Selection
- Users select a base color for their character
- Character can be rotated in a bright studio environment
- Both preset colors and custom color picker are available

### Screen 2: Paint & Style
- Full painting functionality with brush controls
- Sticker placement system
- Layer masking for head/jacket restrictions
- Undo/redo functionality
- Color history tracking

### Screen 3: Environment
- Environment selection (studio, outdoor, sunset, night, forest, beach, dawn, cloudy, indoor)
- Character export as high-quality PNG image with transparent background

## Development Environment

The project includes VS Code configuration files for an optimized development experience:

- **settings.json**: Configures Live Server to use port 5501
- **tasks.json**: Defines a task to start the Python development server on port 8000

Developers can use either:
1. Python's built-in HTTP server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. The included Node.js server: `node server.js` (runs on port 5500)
3. VS Code's built-in task to start the development server

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Zoom controls for detailed work
- Custom sticker upload
- Export painted model as image/3D file
- WebXR support for VR/AR painting
- Advanced brush types and layer system
- Cloud storage integration
